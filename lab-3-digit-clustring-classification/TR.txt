Digit recognition

A task
Determine the number of clusters and split the numbers into clusters.
Suggest an interpretation of clusters.

Each row of the dataset describes a digit.
Numbers scanned with errors
There is a grouping variable in the training sample - the correct number.

The final goal of the task is a model for digit recognition.
And it's not a clustering task

But let's use this solution.
First stage. First, we cluster the observations so that similar numbers come together in groups.
Second phase. We build our own model for each cluster. Will have to build more models,
but each of them will solve a simpler problem, it will be easier to build them, the general
recognition quality will increase.

In the laboratory work, you need to solve the problem of the first stage.
Determine the number of clusters and split the numbers into clusters. You also need to offer
interpretation for each cluster.

Grouping variable "A" cannot be used in clustering,
but it is recommended to use it when interpreting clusters.

There are 7 variables in the data with the names "B" - "H",
measured in nominal scale
0 = line present
1 = no line

Lines correspond to dashes on the calculator screen
B - top horizontal,
C - upper left vertical,
D - upper right vertical,
E - middle horizontal,
F - lower left vertical,
G - lower right vertical,
H - bottom horizontal.

There are 8 variables and 500 observations in the dataset
For some unknown reason, in the data table, each column is present twice

Repeat below the first 10 rows of the dataset

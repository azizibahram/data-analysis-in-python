One of the tasks of consumer segmentation may be the classification of consumers according to needs.
Such segmentation can then help to identify which brands are popular among representatives of different segments, as well as how the company's products could be modified to meet the needs of an attractive segment.
From a marketer's point of view, segments should be interpretable, measurable, and large enough. Typically, segmentation is part of a larger research.
